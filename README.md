## 📘 Introduction

Welcome to the 30 Days of Spring Boot & Microservices challenge! This comprehensive guide will take you from Spring Boot basics to advanced microservices architecture in just 30 days. By the end of this challenge, you'll be an expert in building production-ready microservices applications using Java 8/11, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- Basic Java programming knowledge
- Understanding of OOP concepts
- Familiarity with Maven/Gradle
- Basic understanding of HTTP and REST
- Docker installed on your machine (for later days)
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

### Week 1: Spring Boot Fundamentals
- Modern Java features (Java 8 & 11)
- Spring Boot application structure
- REST API development
- Database integration with JPA
- Security basics

### Week 2: Advanced Spring Boot
- JWT authentication
- Configuration management
- Monitoring and actuator
- Exception handling patterns
- Validation and data integrity

### Week 3: Microservices Architecture
- Service discovery
- API Gateway patterns
- Load balancing
- Circuit breakers
- Distributed tracing
- Centralized configuration

### Week 4: Production Ready Microservices
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Containerization with Docker
- Orchestration with Kubernetes
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring and logging
- Performance optimization

## 🛠️ Setup

### Required Software
```bash
# Java 11
java -version

# Maven
mvn -version

# Docker
docker --version

# Git
git --version
```

### IDE Setup
We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Ultimate Edition for this challenge.

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Day 01** and progress sequentially
2. Each day has its own folder with:
   - README.md with theory and explanations
   - Working code examples
   - Exercises to practice
   - Solutions to exercises
3. **Code along** with the examples
4. **Complete the exercises** before moving to the next day
5. **Build projects** at milestone days (10, 20, 30)

## 📝 Daily Structure

Each day follows this structure:
- **Introduction**: Overview of the day's topics
- **Theory**: Detailed explanations with diagrams
- **Code Examples**: Working implementations
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practice problems
- **Solutions**: Reference implementations
- **Resources**: Additional reading materials

## 🎓 Learning Path

```
Days 1-10: Foundation (Spring Boot Core)
    ↓
Days 11-15: Security & Advanced Features
    ↓
Days 16-22: Microservices Architecture
    ↓
Days 23-27: DevOps & Deployment
    ↓
Days 28-30: Production & Best Practices
```

## 🏆 Milestones

- **Day 10**: Build a complete REST API with security
- **Day 20**: Deploy a microservices ecosystem
- **Day 30**: Production-ready microservices application

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Code Every Day**: Consistency is key
2. **Don't Skip Days**: Each day builds on previous knowledge
3. **Do the Exercises**: Practice reinforces learning
4. **Debug and Experiment**: Break things and fix them
5. **Join the Community**: Share your progress
6. **Build Real Projects**: Apply concepts to your own ideas
